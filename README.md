# Data-Science
There are some projects I have done at MIT as an exchange student. The original datasets are not available to the public. The purpose of this repo is to show my data science skills, such as importing and cleaning data, network analysis, time series analysis and data visualization. See the details in Jupyter Notebook by clicking links.

## 1. [Single-cell RNA-seq analysis](Single-cell RNA-seq analysis.ipynb)

## 2. Ocean Flow Analysis
1. [Flows and correlation](Ocean_Flow/Ocean_Flow_1.ipynb): Finding the ocean flow and correlation patterns
2. [Predicting trajectories](Ocean_Flow/Ocean_Flow_2.ipynb): Simulating the trajectory of a particle moving in the flow
3. [Path planning](Ocean_Flow/Ocean_Flow_3.ipynb): The goal of this part is route a boat through the ocean water  with minimizing the travel time

## 3. Criminal Network Analysis
1. [Investigating a time-varying criminal network](Criminal_Network_Analysis/Criminal_Network_Analysis_1.ipynb): Investigating a time-varying criminal network that is repeatedly disturbed by police forces in CAVIAR project
2. [Co-offending Network](Criminal_Network_Analysis/Criminal_Network_Analysis_2.ipynb): Constructing and analyzing the co-offender network in Canada

## 4. Time Series Analysis
1. [Consumer price index data analysis](Time_Series/Time_Series_1.ipynb): The goal of this part is to analyze the PriceStats data from the MIT Billion Prices Project
2. [The Mauna Loa CO2 concentration](Time_Series/Time_Series_2.ipynb): The goal of this part is to fit the data with some time series models and understand its variations
      
## 5. Cryptocurrency Market_Analysis Project
1. [Project Report](Cryptocurrency_Market_Analysis_Project/6.419_Project_Cryptocurrency_Market_Analysis.pdf)
2. [Project Poster](Cryptocurrency_Market_Analysis_Project/6.419_Project_Poster.pdf)
