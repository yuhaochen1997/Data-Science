# Data-Science
There are some projects I have done at MIT as an exchange student. The original datasets are not available to the public.

## 1. [Single-cell RNA-seq analysis](Single-cell RNA-seq analysis.ipynb)

## 2. Ocean Flow Analysis
1. [Flows and correlation](Ocean_Flow/Ocean_Flow_1.ipynb): Finding the ocean flow and correlation patterns
2. [Predicting trajectories](Ocean_Flow/Ocean_Flow_2.ipynb): Simulating the trajectory of a particle moving in the flow
3. [Path planning](Ocean_Flow/Ocean_Flow_3.ipynb): The goal of this part is route a boat through the ocean water  with minimizing the travel time

## 3. Criminal Network Analysis
